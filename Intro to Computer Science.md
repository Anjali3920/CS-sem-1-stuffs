# Computer Science Basics, Terms, and Keywords
## 1. Basic Concepts
### Algorithm
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It provides a set of rules or instructions to follow in order to achieve a desired outcome.

### Data Structure
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification. Common types include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

### Programming Language
A programming language is a formal set of instructions that can be used to produce a wide range of outputs, including software applications and algorithms. Examples include Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript.

### Database
A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. It allows for efficient data management, retrieval, and manipulation.

## 2. Key Terms and Definitions
### Binary
The binary system is a number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It is the basis of all binary code, which is used to write data for computers.

### Compiling
Compiling is the process of converting high-level programming code into machine code or bytecode that a computer's processor can execute.

### Debugging
Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in a computer program. It involves running the program, identifying issues, and making corrections.

### Encryption
Encryption is a method of securing data by converting it into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It is commonly used in data transmission and storage to ensure privacy.

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

## 3. Common Keywords
API (Application Programming Interface)
An API is a set of rules and tools for building software applications. It specifies how software components should interact and allows different software systems to communicate with each other.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to delivering computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet (the cloud).

### Algorithm Complexity
Algorithm complexity refers to the computational resources required by an algorithm, usually measured in terms of time and space.

### Version Control
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later. Git is a popular version control system.
