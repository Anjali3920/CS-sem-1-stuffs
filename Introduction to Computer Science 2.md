## **2. Networking** üåê

### **What is Networking?**
Networking refers to the exchange of data between computers over a shared medium. It can involve wired connections (Ethernet) or wireless technologies (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).

### **Types of Networks**:
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network within a small geographic area like a home or office.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A larger network that spans cities, countries, or even continents.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A network that covers a city.

## **3. OSI Model (7 Layers of Networking)** üñß

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model defines how communication occurs between two devices. It is composed of **7 layers**:

1. **Physical Layer**: The physical connection between devices (cables, switches).
2. **Data Link Layer**: Manages the movement of data within the same network (MAC addresses).
3. **Network Layer**: Routes the data across networks (IP addresses).
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transmission (TCP/UDP).
5. **Session Layer**: Manages the sessions between network connections.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates the data into a format the application can understand.
7. **Application Layer**: The layer closest to the user, such as email clients, web browsers.

## **4. Programming Languages** üíª

### **Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages**:
- **Compiled Languages**: Convert code into machine language before execution (e.g., C++, Java).
- **Interpreted Languages**: Translate code line by line during execution (e.g., Python, JavaScript).

### **Popular Programming Languages**:
- **Java**: Used for enterprise applications, Android development.

## **5. Blockchain** üîó

### **What is Blockchain?**
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers. It is primarily known for its role in **cryptocurrency** like Bitcoin, but its applications go far beyond finance.

### **Key Features of Blockchain**:
- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the network.
- **Immutability**: Once data is written, it cannot be altered.
- **Transparency**: Everyone has access to the same version of the ledger.

### **Applications of Blockchain**:
- **Cryptocurrency**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others use blockchain for secure transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with the terms written in code.
- **Supply Chain**: Track the origin and movement of goods with immutable records.

## **6. Computer Layers** üñ•Ô∏è

A computer can be conceptualized as having **layers** of components:

1. **Hardware Layer**: CPU, memory, storage.
2. **Firmware Layer**: Low-level control programs (BIOS).
3. **Operating System**: Manages hardware and software resources.
4. **Middleware**: Software that provides common services for applications.
5. **Application Software**: Specific programs that perform user tasks.
6. **User Interface Layer**: Where the user interacts with the system.

## **7. Databases** üóÑÔ∏è

### **What is a Database?**
A **database** is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically. It allows for data storage, management, and retrieval.

### **Types of Databases**:
- **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**: Store data in tables and use SQL for querying (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **NoSQL Databases**: Flexible schema databases, ideal for large-scale applications (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
